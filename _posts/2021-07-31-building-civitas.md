title: Building Civitas
author: Jon Ericson

Stack Overflow started when two bloggers, Jeff Atwood and Joel
Spolsky, noticed there was no good way to get answers to questions
about programming. They put together a prototype, invited their
readers to try it out and even before the public beta the site had
[already
accumulated](https://web.archive.org/web/20080915103343/http://stackoverflow.com/)
many high-quality answers to difficult questions. And then [a miracle
occurred](https://stackoverflow.blog/2008/09/15/then-a-miracle-occurs-public-beta/).

There were other companies working on Q&amp;A sites around the same
time. Let's put a sample in this handy table:

Company | Distinctive | Outcome
------- | ----------- | -------
[Experts Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experts_Exchange) | Answer paywall | Bankruptcy
[Mahalo.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalo.com) | Paid answers | Out of business
[Yahoo! Answers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Answers) | [Babby](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-is-babby-formed) | Shut down
[Quora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quora) | Facebook integration | Still in business
[Stack Overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow) | Community | Sold for $1.8 billion

"Community" has become something of a buzzword in the startup
world. When people think they need "community" it can become a shifty
and gelatinous term. So let me be specific: Stack Overflow was largely
[built by and for the people who use
it](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2008/09/15/stack-overflow-launches/). Community
doesn't just mean (in this case) a bunch of people with a common
interest. Instead it's a group of people who have a sense of ownership
over a common resource. Not only do they provide nearly all of the
content, community input has guided the functional development of the
site from the beginning.

Sorin and I named our new company Civitas, which [Google Translate
says is Latin for
"community"](https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&tl=la&text=community%0A&op=translate). As
I did some research on the name (to make sure it didn't have a rude
connotation), I realized _civitas_ represents the type of community
not dissimilar to Stack Overflow. To the ancient Romans,
[_civitas_ meant citizenship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civitas)
and especially Roman citizenship. 

There's a story from early Christianity that illustrates the importance
of _civitas_. Paul was about to be flogged when he asked if it was
lawful to flog a Roman citizen without trial:

> So the tribune came and said to him, “Tell me, are you a Roman
> citizen?” And he said, “Yes.” The tribune answered, “I bought
> this citizenship for a large sum.” Paul said, “But I am a citizen by
> birth.”&mdash;Acts 22:27-28 ([ESV](https://www.esv.org/Acts+22/))

With Stack Overflow, you can't buy your way in. Nor can you receive
reputation at birth. Instead members earn their place by contributing
to the growing collection of knowledge. People value their membership
in Stack Overflow because it requires sacrifice. That, in turn, it
creates loyalty you can't buy.

Building this sort of community [comes with a
cost](https://jlericson.com/2021/03/23/2021_CMX_report.html) but, done
well, can produce quite satisfactory returns. While other Q&amp;A
companies struggled to source quality answers, Stack Overflow could
rely on their unique community dedicated to answering coding questions
to build a content library. With the effort (and money) saved, the
company was able to spend a decade working on its revenue model. 

Rome wasn't built in a day and neither was Stack Overflow. Fortunately
every organization can take immediate actions to cultivate exceptional
communities. Every community is different, but next steps could be:

* Giving clients a space to talk to each other.
* Interviewing members to hear how they are doing and what you can do better.
* Sending out a survey to your mailing list to gather broad feedback.
* Revamping rules, terms of service and community norms.
* Analyzing data to find barriers to entry.

So here's the sales pitch: **for a moderate one-time fee, we will
create a report for your community with concrete next steps**. There's
no obligation, but we can also help you execute on those steps. Or even
better, we can train your community team to do the work themselves. We
charge an hourly rate for additional consulting, but we believe
clients will consider it a bargain when they see our results.

Sorin and I have years of experience with all sorts of
communities. I've worked with Stack Overflow since the private beta. I
also guided many Stack Exchange sites, including
[Puzzling](https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/), [Space
Exploration](https://space.stackexchange.com/),
[Emacs](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/users/2/jon-ericson) and many
others, to successful launches. Sorin was instrumental in growing the [the Beat The GMAT
Forums](https://www.beatthegmat.com/forums) and managed [College
Confidential's forums](https://www.collegeconfidential.com/). We've
been in the trenches and seen what works (and what, unfortunately)
doesn't.

"Community" has become something of a buzzword in the startup
world. I've talked with people who are hiring community managers or
beginning to engage with online communities. The pandemic accelerated
the trend, of course. It's an exciting time to be in this new and
growing field.

It's also a delicate time. Trends come and go on a whim so nothing
says "community" will still be important and desirable in coming
years. Which would be fine if this sort of engagement were just a
flash in the pan. It's not. It's at least as old as civilization
itself. We're just learning to apply the concept of community to
modern technology.

Sorin and I decided to name our online community consulting business
"Civitas" after the ancient Roman term for citizenship. We believe
giving people a sense of belonging is one of the best investments an
organization can make. If it was powerful enough to propel a
city-state into a vast empire, imagine what community can do for you!

Maybe that sounds too grandiose.

<!--Sorin and I decided to start a consulting business after watching
organizations struggle to effectively engage with online
communities. This shouldn't be a surprise! Companies specialize in
their main line of business and community management is a fairly new
field. Unfortunately learning to interact with an online community
often involves missteps and lost opportunities.

For instance, a company might try to drum up business by posting on
forums. That can result in a high return on investment if other
members of the forum become fans and promote your product or service
on your behalf. The strategy is sometimes called [community
marketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_marketing) and it's
incredibly effective. Or rather, it can be if done right.

Probably the easiest (and least harmful) to go wrong is pulling a
["How do you do, fellow
kids?"](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/13/15966094/30-rock-buscemi-how-do-you-do-fellow-kids-meme-kill-it-please). Trying
to fit in, when you really don't, comes off as mockable. As long as
you've brought your sense of humor, you should be fine.

Unfortunately, people compound their problems by going for the hard
sell. A math tutor might step up to help solve a homework problem, but
stop short of a complete answer with a link to their website. No they
shouldn't give their services away for free, but think about what
other people see. Instead of giving freely to the community, they've
proven they care more about making a buck than making a difference. A
better approach is to solve the entire homework problem (make a
difference) and only occasionally offer tutoring services.

That's just one example of how we can diagnose and help fix problems
in a community strategy. Sorin and I have decades of experience
working with online communities. We can help build a strategy for
working with communities and train others to implement it.
