## Philosophy

Community happens wherever people gather to discuss a common
interest. If an organization is interesting enough to talk about,
there is an online community. Probably several. The question is: Are
you involved in the conversation? We believe investing in online
community building is the single best way to reach customers (existing
and new), gather authentic feedback about products and services, and
create an enduring brand.
