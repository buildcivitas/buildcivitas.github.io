> Jon is an astute long-term observer of [Stack Exchange] culture.&mdash;[Jeff Atwood](https://web.archive.org/web/20131015073107/http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/08/please-welcome-jon-ericson-community-manager/#comment-81460)

## Unicorn Meta Zoo

I hosted a podcast with other Stack Exchange community managers which
I called ["Unicorn Meta Zoo"](https://unicorn-meta-zoo.github.io/)
because I figured it would be easy to search for. Just my luck that a
popular card game called
[MetaZoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetaZoo) was released a year
later and one of the cards is a unicorn. Anyway, here are the
episodes:

1. [Why another
   podcast?](https://unicorn-meta-zoo.github.io/episodes/why-podcast.mp3)
2. [What is the role of
   moderators?](https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/unicorn-meta-zoo.github.io/episodes/moderation.mp3)
3. [How do we grade
   questions?](https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/unicorn-meta-zoo.github.io/episodes/question-grade.mp3)
4. [What makes for a healthy
   community?](https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/unicorn-meta-zoo.github.io/episodes/healthy-communities.mp3)
5. [Interview with Cesar
   M](https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/unicorn-meta-zoo.github.io/episodes/cesar.mp3)_
6. [Interview with
