## Unicorn Meta Zoo

I hosted a podcast with other Stack Exchange community managers which
I called ["Unicorn Meta Zoo"](https://unicorn-meta-zoo.github.io/)
because I figured it would be easy to search for. Just my luck that a
popular card game called
[MetaZoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetaZoo) was released a year
later and one of the cards is a unicorn. Anyway, here are the
episodes:

   podcast?](https://unicorn-meta-zoo.github.io/episodes/why-podcast.mp3)
